# Image-Classification-with-Deep-Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network model using the Keras library in Python to predict the class of images as honeybee (class = 1) or not a honeybee (class=0).  
Max Pooling is used for dimensionality reduction along with 50% Dropout regularization to avoid overfitting. The resulting model consists of more than 3 million parameters. 

The accuracy of the model can be increased by training the model for more epochs. Due to hardware constraints, a previously trained model trained for 200 epochs has been utilized for making the predictions.
